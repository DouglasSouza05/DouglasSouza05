# Hello there stranger 👽, be welcome to my Github! Feel free to look at all my projects made so far 😎.
I'm currently studying at INATEL (Instituto Nacional de Telecomunicações) in Brasil ❤. So far, i've learnt C++, Java, SQL and little bit of Python and expecting to learn more about each one of them, and also others programming languagens out there. 
I am looking forward to getting a chance to work on games development 👾, robotics industry 🤖 or the cybersecurity area 🐱‍💻. Very interested in each one of these 🤓.
One project i've made is the old good Snake Game that you can find on the ProjetoFinal_POO_Snake_Game repository, just a simple project for my class but hope you like it 😄. Currently doing a project on Blender for Fetin (Feira Tecnológica do Inatel) and it's getting real nice 🧐.
You can reach me through instagram @douglasbsouza01, telegram DouglasSouza05 and fianlly whatsapp (55) 35 98821-4957 👀.
A curiosity about me is that one of my favourites games of all time is Dota 2 from Steam. If you play it and wants a partner, give me a call. Let's defend some ancients  🧠.
