# Hello there stranger 👽, be welcome to my Github! Feel free to look at all my projects made so far.
I'm currently studying at INATEL (Instituto Nacional de Telecomunicações) in Brasil ❤. So far, i've learnt C++, Java, SQL, Python, JavaScript, HTML, CSS and a little bit of C# and expecting to learn more about each one of them, as well as other tecnologies out there. 
I am looking forward to getting a chance to work on softwares development 👾, robotics industry 🤖 or the cybersecurity area 🐱‍💻. Very interested in each one of these.
One project i've made is the old Snake Game made with Java that you can find on the POO_Snake_Game repository, just a simple project for my class but hope you like it. Another project i've made in the past couple weeks is my To Do List, using HTML, CSS & JavaScript that you can find on ToDoList-HTML-CSS-JS. Please check it out whenever you can, hope you enjoy the color pallet haha 😄.
Other projects i've made couple months ago were a Agenda App using mainly python and a Units Converter using C# for my college's assignments 🎓. Both of them have User Interface (UI), Unit Tests as well as a Unit Testing Framework, Tests Results, Continuous Integration Practices (CI) and Pipeline Configurations through Github Actions 🔥. These projetcs were made along with some friends from Inatel as a team, each one focusing on a specific task for the final result. You can find them on Trabalho_Final_C214_Lab and Seminario_C214 repositories, respectively 🖥️. All instructions on Readme file.
I have other's works (finished and unfinished) om my public repositories, in case you may want to check it out 👀.
