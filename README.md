# Hello there stranger 👽, be welcome to my Github! Feel free to look at all my projects made so far 😎.
I'm currently studying at INATEL (Instituto Nacional de Telecomunicações) in Brasil ❤. So far, i've learnt C++, Java, SQL, Python and little bit of JavaScript and expecting to learn more about each one of them, and also other programming languagens out there. 
I am looking forward to getting a chance to work on games development 👾, robotics industry 🤖 or the cybersecurity area 🐱‍💻. Very interested in each one of these 🤓.
One project i've made is the old but gold Snake Game made with Java that you can find on the ProjetoFinal_POO_Snake_Game repository, just a simple project for my class but hope you like it 😄. Another project i've made in the past couple weeks is my To Do List, using HTML, CSS & JavaScript. Please check it out whenever you can, hope you enjoy the color pallet haha. Currently working and studying more about Fast Api and Broker Mqtt using Python, very interesting 🧐.
